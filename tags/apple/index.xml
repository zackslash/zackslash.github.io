      <description>NOTE!: It&amp;rsquo;s now the year 2020 and I believe this technique no longer works in the latest versions of xcode. I have archived the github repo. I&amp;rsquo;ve left everything public so the information still exists. What follows is my original article from 2014&amp;hellip;
There have been times when building xcode projects from terminal has been very convenient, i’ve also done it in a lot of scripts, however there is a drawback to this technique and I hope to solve it in this article.</description>

      <description>If you want to simulate GPS data in the iOS simulator you have two choices, Apple&amp;rsquo;s ‘real’ data (City run, freeway drive ect) or you can choose a single lat,long to simulate being in a static location, but… what if we want to simulate our own motorcycle ride or boat journey and work with ‘real’ GPS data in the simulator?
My open source tool ‘XJourney‘ (Available HERE) achieves just this. Using XJourney you can put your own GPS data into the iOS simulator to simulate a full GPS Journey just like Apple’s own.</description>

I have seen a lot of people distribute these frameworks as a .zip with the prebuilt .a, separate .h files and resources, but there is a cleaner, friendlier way, that is to package everything into a .framework &amp;amp; .bundle then distribute these as a .dmg.
We then move from giving customers a .</description>
